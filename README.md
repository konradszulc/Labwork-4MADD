# Instructions for Grading purposes

After Cloning GitHub Repo:

1. Use npm install to recieve all local dependencies

2. Use npm install firebase to recieve local dependencies for Firebase

3. Upload .env provided by Team 4 to utilize specific Firebase (has example code snippets and some authenticated users)

4. Register own account or Login with example user Email: maddwork@gmail.com Password: MaddStuff1000%

NOTE: .env contains public ApiKey and uID information, This was not pushed to GitHub repo as a safety net. This is considered good practice, and even GitHub scans/alerts users if such information is present in public repos. The .env has variables named that correlate with the variables in firebaseConfig.ts, for the file to grab the right credentials.
